________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Hi,

Some of students getting timeout error (MongoDB.Driver.MongoConnectionException: An exception occurred while opening a connection to the server.) when its try to seeding the database (SeedData method) from mongodb. I do fresh setup into my computer and try again but it worked well for me so thats why Ä± cant reproduce the error.
When I checked from google, I saw below links and solutions;

Solutions:

Solution 1 - Add connection string to "?connect=replicaSet" :

Please refer below solutions with overriding our existing connectionSting in CatalogContext.cs when getting client in here "var client = new MongoClient(settings.ConnectionString);".
In below solutions they try with adding db name at the end of connection string, maybe it can solve.
new MongoClient("mongodb://username:password@ds011111.mongolab.com:11111/db-name")

---------- ---------- ----------

Add "?connect=replicaSet" to the end of your connection string if connecting to MongoLab.

new MongoClient("mongodb://username:password@ds011111.mongolab.com:11111/db-name?connect=replicaSet")
This JIRA ticket has some details: https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/CSHARP-1160

Basically the default is to connect to a replica set member. But MongoLab's Single-Node settings are actually a single node replica set and this causes us to not trust it. Appending ?connect=replicaSet to your connection string will force the driver to move into replica set mode and all will work.

---------- ---------- ----------

I am replacing the connection string method in like below.

new MongoClient("mongodb://username:password@ds011111.mongolab.com:11111/db-name")
Now it's solved.

Please see the answer from Paul Lemke.

[CSHARP-2540] A timeout occured after 30000ms selecting a server , Add "?connect=replicaSet" to the end of your connection string if connecting to MongoLab. A timeout occured after 30000ms selecting a server using CompositeServerSelector{ Selectors = MongoDB.Driver.

Solution 2 :

If these solutions are not worked for you, please change the port-forwarding port number different form 27017 to different number as below way and try again;

services:
    catalogdb:
        container_name: catalogdb
        restart: always
        volumes:
            - ${WEBAPP_STORAGE_HOME}/site:/data/db
        ports:
            - "27018:27017"

Solution 3 :

Check your firewall settings.
It seams your code failed on the socket connection...Check if the mongoDB port is opened on the firewall (possibly not)...

Most replies mention about network permissions, Could you please check how you can give access permission to mongo db driver ? Because you even cant connect to interactive terminal so maybe the problem is only related with network permissions.

Solution 4 :

In case anyone is getting a Mongo Timeout Error, replace the colon on CatalogDatabaseSettings:ConnectionString with double underscores like so CatalogDatabaseSettings__ConnectionString.

For interactive terminal you should use linux based container system of docker
